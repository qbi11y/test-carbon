# Carbon Design Kit

The Carbon Design Kit is a living, breathing document that contains all of our visual assets (components, iconography, color palettes, grids, templates, responsive behavior, etc). This document evolves and changes as we collaborate with partners and service teams. All of the assets that live in the Design Kit can also be found on our <a href="http://carbondesignsystem.com/">Carbon Design System</a> website.

## üìö Getting Started

### Designers

* The Carbon Design Kit now uses the new typeface **IBM Plex**. It is open sourced and free to download from the [IBM GitHub repo](https://github.com/IBM/type/tree/master/fonts) 
* Download the latest version of the Carbon Design Kit by clicking on the latest kit file in this repo (`Carbon_Design-Kit_x.x.x.sketch`) then on the next age click the download button or ‚ÄúView Raw‚Äù. (Note: downloading from the main repo page will download the entire repo including previous version)

* The Design Kit requires having the latest version of <a href="https://www.sketchapp.com/">Sketch</a> installed.
* Open the Design Kit file in Sketch
* Core visual styles, components, and templates are broken out into respective pages
* Use the components and core visual styles to build out your design
* Updates to the Design Kit will be posted in our change log, so check back frequently for changes!

### Developers: 
Our Carbon Components <a href="http://www.carbondesignsystem.com/getting-started/developers">Getting Started</a> guide has all the instructions you need to get up and running our code base. 


## üåü Contributing

### Design
Follow the steps in our [Contributing guidelines](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-design-kit/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to contribute to the Carbon Design System.

### Code
For instructions on contributing to our component library please read our <a href="https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-components/blob/master/docs/contributing.md">contributing docs</a> for Carbon Comoponents. 


## üíª Workflow

### Sketch Libraries
Sketch Libraries is a new Sketch feature that allows designers to share Symbols across documents and easily update to the latest symbol changes. Read the [Sketch Libraries Overview wiki](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-design-kit/wiki/Sketch-Libraries-Overview) to learn more about how to use and implement Sketch Libraries in your workflow.

### Plugins
The Carbon Design Kit now comes with the Sketch Palettes plugin which allows you to import Carbon specific palettes into your Sketch files. There are four Carbon palettes (a Carbon default palette and three data vis palettes) included with the Carbon Design Kit download. We also have a [wiki](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-design-kit/wiki/Suggested-Sketch-Plugins) of suggested Sketch plugins to help make your design workflow more efficient.
